            <p class="posp-para text-center">
                Group Term Insurance is a specialized form of life insurance that extends coverage to a defined group of
                individuals under a single master contract. This type
                of insurance is commonly provided by employers or workers as a valuable employee benefit, offering life
                insurance protection to members of the group.
                Unlike individual life insurance policies, Group Term Insurance streamlines the process by eliminating
                the need for individual underwriting or medical
                examinations for each member. Coverage is extended to all eligible members of the group without the
                hassle of separate application processes, making it a
                convenient and accessible option for employees..

                <h2 class="pt-5">Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>In case of any dispute or disagreement 
                    regarding the claim settlement, the 
                    beneficiary or the policyholder can raise 
                    the concern with the insurance company’s 
                    grievance redressal department. Most 
                    insurers have dedicated customer service 
                    teams to address policyholders’ concerns 
                    promptly.</p>
